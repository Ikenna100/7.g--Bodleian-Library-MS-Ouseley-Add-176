    "description":"\"The Shahnamah writings and illustrations are a beacon of Islamic history and culture. Identified as one of the leading factors in the preservation and continuation of classic Persian culture the works have stood the test of time. The epic poem takes readers on journey’s centered around dealing with problems in life, love, war, and many other things that offered lessons or teachings on life. The poems range in diversity from fictional to some even having some element of historical accuracy.Recurring characters come fictional and mythical, and others real people. With stories so diverse and rich in imagery illustrations have been paired with the writing. Detailed pictures often times with multiple meanings and hidden connections accompany many of the tales in the Shahnamah. The illustrations vary based on artist and region giving those with an imagination the freedom showcase their interpretation of the stories. Many of the drawings are held  in high regard and recognized for their artistic strengths. Let’s take a deeper look at the Shahnamah and why it’s still so highly revered to this day."},

    "description":"The Shahnameh was written by Ferdowsi an Iranian Persian-speaking man born in 940. He did not have an overly luxurious upbringing, but also wasn’t dirt poor. Later in life he was known as a skilled writer, and for that reason he was commissioned by the king to document history, and stories from the past. The deal was that for every 1000 couplets Ferdowsi wrote he would get 1000 gold coins in exchange. This could be the reason why the works contain a record setting 50,000 couplets! Consisting of 62 stories and 990 chapters, Ferdowsi took full advantage of the offer. Devoting 30 years to writing, Ferdowsi put his all into the writing text as he had a reputation to uphold. Unfortunately, during the 30 years spent on the composition, the king felt that Ferdowsi had grown arrogant and full of himself. For this reason, when the Shahnamah was completed,  and Ferdowsi came to collect his 60,000 Gold gold coins,  but the King had a different idea. Instead, he was given 60,000 silver coins by the king, as the king wanted to humble the writer. Ferdowsi was furious and left a poem basically cursing the king out. He at that point had become an enemy of the monarchy and was even said to be condemned to death via trampling by elephants. Ferdowsi was later got forgivenessforgiven, and lived out the rest of his days secluded from the community. Years later the king felt badly and sent a camel with the pieces of gold silk, and more. The author that wrote one of the most legendary collections of writing world literature was almost short short-changed for his efforts."},

    "description":"Many artists throughout the years have put their own interpretation and understanding of what exactly is occurring in the story. Other times pictures that may not have a story may be featured in the book leaving the reader to follow up on the origins of the picture and the significance to the history of Iran at that time. Images to pay homage or show affinity for certain figures could also be included in the illustrations if decided on by the artist. Regardless of the subject of the illustration, the visuals are held in high regard. So much so that as recently as this year a picture of the warrior Rostam corralling his horse Raksh was sold for a whopping 8.1 million euros. Part of the intrigue with the illustrations is the visual busyness of the illustrations sometimes showing multiple scenes depicted in one display. The colour schemes and contrasts are as rich as the stories they represent. I’ll be breaking down one of the many illustrations in the Shahnameh held by the Oxford Bodleian Library."},

    "description":"\This image sits at within the preface of the Ibrahim Shah Shahnameh. Not accompanied by a story of its own in couplets but, the Shahnamah, the image still makes a commentary on a legend historical figure from the past. The man this pieceruler portrayed is named after, Ibrahim Sultan was a jack of all trades and patron of this copy of the Shahnamah, who seemed to excel at everything. Ibrahim Sultan was a ruler of the short short-lived Timurid empire; the Sultan had manyhis talents including included architecture architectural patronage and design and calligraphy. He was also an avid reader and fan of literature. For this reason, this image was added in as somewhat of a tribute to his contributions to society, and culture at that time. As a lover of art, It’s it’s only fitting for him to be included in a writing manuscript such as this, while also beinghaving himself depicted as being in a powerful position. But bBecause he was also at one point the leader of the Timurid empire, he had to lead conquests in the hopes of expanding reach and influence. In this picture, we can see him doing just that. This The scene could potentially be of him subduing people that were under the rival leader of the Turkmen Eksandar B. Qara Yusuf. This event is looked at as one of his crowning jewels in terms of achievements as he aided his father in defeating the Turkmen. We can see men on horses and some tucked in opposite corners of the drawing. These would be part of the cavalry their accompanying the Sultan Ibrahim. With soldiers Wielding wielding swords in the direction of scampering men, and horses appearing to galloping towards them,  the element of intimidation is very prevalent. The three men illustrated feel that same sentiments as one is lookinglooks back in terror while the others are facingface forward trying to escape.\""},

    "description":Much can be derived from details in the illustrations just as this one. Starting withsuch as the clothing of the men on the horses. They have varying colours of cloaks and helmets, but are still dressed in the same style of attire. We can see from the man in the bottom left on a horse and what seems to be Ibrahim on a horse in the green wearing garments that look long and drawn out. This signifies wealth because these piscespieces were likely made from silk. Silk, both now and then, iwas not a cheap material so using being adorned in extra fabric as they arelike they did shows that they were are wealthy. Juxtapose Contrast this with the outfits of the men who are running. They are in skimpier clothes and shorts. They Their attire looks more mix mix-and and-match compared to the more uniform noblemen pursuing them. For this reason, we can assume these 3 are working class or peasants. Even the horses a are draped in their own splendid attire. And all All horses and noble men are fitted with some type of headgear, which some appear to have gold on them. An especially interesting part of this picture amongst many is the range of skin colours of some of the members of the group with Ibrahim. The skin tones vary, and this could be because sometimes individuals from who were conquered by the Timurid empire would then start to fight alongside the Timurids.}"

    "description":"\In this image we see a staple of illustrations on the Shahnamah vibrant rich colour.Obviously due to the age of the illustration some shine has been lost, but we can still see the dynamic use of colour throughout. Eye catching reds are featured on the clokes of some of the horses and one of the men running. The rich noble men on horses have cloaks varying from light green, dark green, purple, and more. The grass of the hill appears to be lightly texture to give more of grass look to it. The variety of fabric options is on full display showcasing different shades and combinations of styles.The hill behind has an interesting look. Lined with what looks purple but could actually just be thick black lines that may have faded over time it may look a bit ambiguous. The ripples in the shape are what make it know that this is in fact a mountain. The ripples are just the characters and cracks of the mountain. The blue sky in the background peaking through is also not to be forgotten. We can see pastel-like clouds in the sky to further accentuate the sky feature.One strength of illustrations of this style is their ability to layer, but not have people lost. In the right and left opposing corners we see men huddled up, but when you look at them you can still recognize individual features like facial features and their particular garment or headwear. I say this to point at the attention to detail and how the artist did not cut corners when they very easily could have.

    "description":"\"The Shahnamah has been studied and read countless times. And as extensive and creative as it is it’s no wonder why. There’s so much information yet so much ambiguity mixed all together. Real mixed with the make believe or exaggerated. Calligraphy and illustration mended into one. This mix of attributes is why the Shahnamah is so captivating and has stood the test of time. The combinations play off each other seamlessly and coupled with thrilling historical stories it’s no wonder why it still holds weight today. The contents written down were so uniquely organized and written, that it was only right for the illustrations to be the same. We looked at the depiction Of Sultan Ibrahim in battle and we got an idea of just the amount of power he had at his disposal. Details throughout lead readers on a intellectual journey that makes you analyze every detail in hopes that it tells you more about the past or what’s happening in the picture. Through these slides i hope the magic and creativity of the Shahnamah is clear!
