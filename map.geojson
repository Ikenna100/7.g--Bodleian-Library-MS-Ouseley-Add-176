    "description":"\"The Shahnamah writings and illustrations are a beacon of Islamic history and culture. Identified as one of the leading factors in the preservation and continuation of classic Persian culture the works have stood the test of time. The epic poem takes readers on journey’s centered around dealing with problems in life, love, war, and many other things that offered lessons or teachings on life. The poems range in diversity from fictional to some even having some element of historical accuracy.Recurring characters come fictional and mythical, and others real people. With stories so diverse and rich in imagery illustrations have been paired with the writing. Detailed pictures often times with multiple meanings and hidden connections accompany many of the tales in the Shahnamah. The illustrations vary based on artist and region giving those with an imagination the freedom showcase their interpretation of the stories. Many of the drawings are held  in high regard and recognized for their artistic strengths. Let’s take a deeper look at the Shahnamah and why it’s still so highly revered to this day."},

    "geometry":{"typeThe Shahnameh was written by Ferdowsi an Iranian man born in 940. He did not have an over luxurious upbringing, but also wasn’t dirt poor. Later in life he was known as a skilled writer, and for that reason he was commissioned by the king to document history, and stories from the past. The deal was for every 1000 couplets Ferdowsi wrote he would get 1000 gold coins in exchange. This could be the reason why the works contain a record setting 50,000 couplets! Consisting of 62 stories and 990 chapters Ferdowsi took full advantage of the offer. Devoting 30 years to writing Ferdowsi put his all into the writing as he had a reputation to uphold. Unfortunately during the 30 years the king felt that Ferdowsi had grown arrogant and full of himself. For this reason, when the Shahnamah was completed, Ferdowsi came to collect his 60,000 Gold coins, but the King had a different idea. Instead he was given 60,000 silver coins by the king, as the king wanted to humble the writer. Ferdowsi was furious and left a poem basically cursing the king out. He at that point had become an enemy of the monarchy and was even said to be condemned to death via trampling by elephants. Ferdowsi later got forgiveness, and lived out secluded from the community. Years later the king felt bad and sent a camel with the pieces of gold silk, and more. The author that wrote one of the most legendary collections of writing was almost short changed for his efforts.:"Point","coordinates":[1385,1360]}},

    "description":{"\"Many artists throughout the years have put their own interpretation and understanding of what exactly is occurring in the story. Other times pictures that may not have a story may be featured in the book leaving the reader to follow up on the origins of the picture and the significance to the history of Iran at that time. Images to pay homage or show affinity for certain figures could also be included in the illustrations if decided on by the artist. Regardless of the subject of the illustration, the visuals are held in high regard. So much so that as recently as this year a picture of the warrior Rostam corralling his horse Raksh was sold for a whopping 8.1 million euros. Part of the intrigue with the illustrations is the visual busyness of the illustrations sometimes showing multiple scenes depicted in one display. The colour schemes and contrasts are as rich as the stories they represent. I’ll be breaking down one of the many illustrations in the Shahnameh held by the Oxford Bodleian Library.

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
