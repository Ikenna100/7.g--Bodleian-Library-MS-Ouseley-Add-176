    "description":"\"The Shahnamah writings and illustrations are a beacon of Islamic history and culture. Identified as one of the leading factors in the preservation and continuation of classic Persian culture the works have stood the test of time. The epic poem takes readers on journey’s centered around dealing with problems in life, love, war, and many other things that offered lessons or teachings on life. The poems range in diversity from fictional to some even having some element of historical accuracy.Recurring characters come fictional and mythical, and others real people. With stories so diverse and rich in imagery illustrations have been paired with the writing. Detailed pictures often times with multiple meanings and hidden connections accompany many of the tales in the Shahnamah. The illustrations vary based on artist and region giving those with an imagination the freedom showcase their interpretation of the stories. Many of the drawings are held  in high regard and recognized for their artistic strengths. Let’s take a deeper look at the Shahnamah and why it’s still so highly revered to this day.

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
